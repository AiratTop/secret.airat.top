/**
 * The liveness probe, and the reason it is not a one-liner.
 *
 * `/health` sits ahead of the rate limiter on purpose: a status checker that receives a
 * 429 reports an outage that is not happening. That leaves it as the one unmetered path
 * to D1, so it must not turn request volume into database load.
 *
 * Two things stop it. A short cache, so a stream of probes costs one query per interval.
 * And single-flight, because a cache alone does not: it is filled only once the query
 * returns, so every probe arriving while the first is still in flight passes the same
 * empty cache and starts a query of its own. A hundred concurrent probes made a hundred
 * queries — the stampede the cache was supposed to prevent. Concurrent callers now await
 * the one query already running.
